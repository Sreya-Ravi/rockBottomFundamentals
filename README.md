# rockBottomFundamentals
The child repo: rockBottomFundamentals, consists of solutions to all the fundamental-concepts-related problem-solving questions solved from various coding platforms. It is one of the many child repos of the root repo: [masterDSA](https://github.com/Sreya-Ravi/masterDSA). 

<br/>

> The master repo: masterDSA, is the root repo that consists of links to its child repos, each of which represents a Data Structure or an Algorithm topic, and consists of solutions to problems (named PS0,PS1..so on, for easy reference of a problem), that relate particularly to that topic.

<br/>

One new problem from a random topic will be published everyday to its corresponding repo. <br/>
To check out the --problem of the day-- and to access all other Data Structures and Algorithms, check out the master repo: --> [masterDSA](https://github.com/Sreya-Ravi/masterDSA).

```
function oneProblemWithSolutionWillBePublishedEveryDay(problem , solution)-->
    publish(problem)
    publish(solution)
    return
for i : (0 --> n) call oneProblemWithSolutionWillBePublishedEveryDay(PS_i , Sol_i)
```
